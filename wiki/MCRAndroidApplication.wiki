Overview of the Android application part of the project

= Class Structure =
This section is for people who are interested in developing an Android application.
Based on our admittedly limited understanding of Android development:
 * The activity is the main function that is called when the application starts
 * The preview is the camera preview box
   * It holds the camera as well as displays the camera preview
   * A function that takes the picture is called when the preview surface is touched
 * The handler is created solely to get messages from the worker thread, this allows us to have a separate thread for work and display
 * The worker thread sends the image data to our server

= Details =
 * Camera preview is started
 * Touching the surface takes a photo and sends to the server as HTTP POST
 * Plays a "waiting" sound to notify the user that processing is in progress
 * Reads the response from the server
 * Plays audio corresponding to the result of the processing.
